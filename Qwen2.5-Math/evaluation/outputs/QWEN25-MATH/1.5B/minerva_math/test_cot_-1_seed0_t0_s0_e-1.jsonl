The difference between these two energies is the energy required to excite the electron from the ground state to the $n=5$ state, which is $E_5-E_1=-0.544-(-13.6)=13.056$ eV.

Therefore, the equation of the supply curve is $X_{s} = 0.5P$.\n\n\nSolve for the equilibrium price and quantity of steel in this market.\nAnswer: The equilibrium price is the price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.  Setting $X_{d} = X_{s}$, we have\n\n$$100 - 0.25P = 0.5P\\Rightarrow P = \\frac{100}{0.75} = \\boxed{\\$133.33}$$\n\nThe equilibrium quantity is the quantity demanded (or supplied) at the equilibrium price.  Substituting $P = 133.33$ into either the demand or supply equation, we have\n\n$$X_{d} = 100 - 0.25(133.33) = \\boxed{58.33}$$\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium price is $\\$133.33$ per ton and the equilibrium quantity is $58.33$ million tons.\n\n\nSolve for the price elasticity of demand at the equilibrium price.\nAnswer: The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.  Using the demand equation, we have\n\n$$\\frac{\\Delta X_{d}}{X_{d}} = -0.25\\frac{\\Delta P}{P}$$\n\nTherefore, the price elasticity of demand at the equilibrium price is $-0.25$."], "pred": ["58.33"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}
