{"idx": 61, "question": "Preamble: The following subproblems refer to a circuit with the following parameters. Denote by $I(t)$ the current (where the positive direction is, say, clockwise) in the circuit and by $V(t)$ the voltage increase across the voltage source, at time $t$. Denote by $R$ the resistance of the resistor and $C$ the capacitance of the capacitor (in units which we will not specify)-both positive numbers. Then\n\\[\nR \\dot{I}+\\frac{1}{C} I=\\dot{V}\n\\]\n\nSubproblem 0: Suppose that $V$ is constant, $V(t)=V_{0}$. Solve for $I(t)$, with initial condition $I(0)$.\n\n\nSolution: When $V$ is constant, the equation becomes $R \\dot{I}+\\frac{1}{C} I=0$, which is separable. Solving gives us\n\\[\nI(t)=\\boxed{I(0) e^{-\\frac{t}{R C}}\n}\\]. \n\nFinal answer: The final answer is I(0) e^{-\\frac{t}{R C}}\n. I hope it is correct.\n\nSubproblem 1: It is common to write the solution to the previous subproblem in the form $c e^{-t / \\tau}$.

Let's go through the steps in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the utility function and the budget constraint\nThe utility function is:\n\\[ u(x, y) = x^{\\frac{1}{2}} + y \\]\n\nThe budget constraint is:\n\\[ p x + y = m \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the marginal rate of substitution (MRS)\nThe MRS is the rate at which the consumer is willing to substitute one good for another while maintaining the same level of utility. It is given by the negative ratio of the marginal utilities of the two goods.\n\nThe marginal utility of \\(x\\) (MU\\(_x\\)) is:\n\\[ \\text{MU}_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\]\n\nThe marginal utility of \\(y\\) (MU\\(_y\\)) is:\n\\[ \\text{MU}_y = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 1 \\]\n\nThus, the MRS is:\n\\[ MRS = -\\frac{\\text{MU}_x}{\\text{MU}_y} = -\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}{1} = -\\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Set the MRS equal to the price ratio\nAt the optimal consumption bundle, the MRS should equal the price ratio of the two goods. The price ratio is:\n\\[ \\frac{p_x}{p_y} = \\frac{p}{1} = p \\]\n\nSo, we set:\n\\[ -\\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} = -p \\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} = p \\]\n\\[ x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} = 2p \\]\n\\[ x = \\left(2p\\right)^{-2} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{1}{4p^2} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Substitute \\(x\\) back into the budget constraint to find \\(y\\)\nUsing the budget constraint \\(p x + y = m\\):\n\\[ p \\left(\\frac{1}{4p^2}\\right) + y = m \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4p} + y = m \\]\n\\[ y = m - \\frac{1}{4p} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Verify the condition \\(m > \\frac{1}{4p}\\)\nThe condition \\(m > \\frac{1}{4p}\\) ensures that the consumer can afford the optimal bundle. If \\(m \\leq \\frac{1}{4p}\\), the consumer would not be able to purchase the optimal bundle.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe quantity of the first good \\(x\\) in the optimal consumption bundle is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4p^2}} \\]"], "pred": ["\\frac{1}{4p^2}"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

All we have done is to shift the minimum position and minimum energy, but the potential is still quadratic. The harmonic frequency $\\omega$ remains unchanged.\nSince the potential now is a harmonic oscillator with frequency $\\omega$ and a constant offset, we can easily write down the energy levels:\n\\[\nE_{v}=\\boxed{\\hbar \\omega(v+1 / 2)-\\frac{E_{0}^{2} e^{2}}{2 m \\omega^{2}}}\n\\]", "code": ["To find the energy levels \\( E_v \\) of the harmonic oscillator subject to the perturbation by an electric field, we will use first-order perturbation theory. The unperturbed Hamiltonian \\( H_0 \\) and the perturbation \\( V(x) \\) are given by:\n\n\\[\nH_0 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_e} + \\frac{1}{2} k x^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV(x) = E_0 e x\n\\]\n\nThe energy levels of the unperturbed harmonic oscillator are:\n\n\\[\nE_v = \\hbar \\omega \\left( v + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\omega = \\left( \\frac{k}{m_e} \\right)^{1/2}\\).\n\nIn first-order perturbation theory, the first-order correction to the energy levels \\( E_v \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nE_v^{(1)} = \\langle \\psi_v^{(0)} | V(x) | \\psi_v^{(0)} \\rangle\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\psi_v^{(0)} \\) are the eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian \\( H_0 \\).\n\nThe eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator are:\n\n\\[\n\\psi_v(x) = \\left( \\frac{m_e \\omega}{\\pi \\hbar} \\right)^{1/4} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^v v!}} H_v \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e \\omega}{\\hbar}} x \\right) e^{-\\frac{m_e \\omega x^2}{2\\hbar}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( H_v \\) are the Hermite polynomials.\n\nNow, we need to compute the matrix element:\n\n\\[\nE_v^{(1)} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi_v^*(x) V(x) \\psi_v(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( V(x) = E_0 e x \\):\n\n\\[\nE_v^{(1)} = E_0 e \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi_v^*(x) x \\psi_v(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nUsing the properties of the Hermite polynomials, we know that:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi_v^*(x) x \\psi_v(x) \\, dx = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m_e \\omega} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e \\omega}{\\pi \\hbar}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^v v!}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H_v \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e \\omega}{\\hbar}} x \\right) x e^{-\\frac{m_e \\omega x^2}{2\\hbar}} \\, dx\n\\]\n\nThe integral involving the Hermite polynomial and the Gaussian function can be simplified using the orthogonality property of Hermite polynomials. For the first-order correction, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H_v \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e \\omega}{\\hbar}} x \\right) x e^{-\\frac{m_e \\omega x^2}{2\\hbar}} \\, dx = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m_e \\omega} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e \\omega}{\\pi \\hbar}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^v v!}} \\left( \\frac{m_e \\omega}{\\hbar} \\right)^{1/2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^v v!}} \\left( \\frac{m_e \\omega}{\\hbar} \\right)^{1/2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^v v!}} \\left( \\frac{m_e \\omega}{\\hbar} \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H_v \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e \\omega}{\\hbar}} x \\right) x e^{-\\frac{m_e \\omega x^2}{2\\hbar}} \\, dx = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m_e \\omega} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e \\omega}{\\pi \\hbar}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^v v!}} \\left(
